# Minimal-CNN-Archtecture
Minimun CNN Archtecture for Medical 

I am currently in the process of developing a Minimal CNN architecture tailored for the classification of medical images. This architecture is designed to be highly efficient in terms of computational resources, making it suitable for deployment on mobile devices with limited computing power. Despite its minimalist design, this CNN achieves comparable performance to larger architectures such as DenseNet and ResNet, as well as other architectures like MobileNet that are specifically optimized for similar tasks.

#### Results:
These are the preliminar results presented by the trained CNN in the same conditions and datasets.
